Build a RoR application to manage your media items collection.
 
It should be possible to create a user account and to sign in and out as a user. 
A user can manage and search his own collection as well as to search and make certain items public (visible to non-users).
 
A media item could either be a link to a video (i.e youtube) or an image.
